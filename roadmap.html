                      Right out of the gate, the new ownership decided that certain fundamental changes needed to take place so that more of the community could partake in the experience of having a masternode. During the bull run of 2017, many of
                      the bigger masternode names in cryptocurrency had pricetags in the tens of thousands of dollars. <br> <br>As the transfer of ownership took place, it cost <b>30 million</b> LindaCoin to buy a masternode and participate in that
                      reward program associated with helping the blockchain via this method. <br>However, the team wanted more people to have the opportunity to have a masternode, and <b>lowered the amount of coins needed to 2 million</b>. This drop
                      added over <b>1,000 nodes</b> to the list and greatly contributed to the blockchain by having more masternodes running on it. The community enjoyed this change, and continues to embrace the ability to own a masternode at this
                      quantity. Metrix expects to keep this number of coins needed as the threshold for a masternode indefinitely.

                      A huge partnership from the past year was between <b>Metrix and Whopper</b>. Whopper is a premier supplier of cryptocurrency cold storage cards. Cold storage allows cryptocurrency holders the upmost security by keeping the coins
                      of exchanges, wallets, and other third party application. <br> <br> With a Whopper card for Metrix, users are able to purchase Metrix and send it to the address printed on the card that only the user will be have access to. This
                      means that the only person with digital access to this address is the user through having the physical card. Whopper is fast becoming the leader in cold storage solutions, and Metrix has their own cards with company designs.
                      Giveaways are routinely done where Whopper packages are sent to users with the cards preloaded with Metrix on them as a prize to those that won. <br> <br>Regardless of whether you win a giveaway or not, it’s a good idea to have
                      sole control of your private keys if you aren’t staking or running a masternode with your Metrix coins. The solution is simple: <b>Whopper cold storage and Metrix</b>

                      The creation of <b>MyNodePool</b> was almost entirely out of request by our users who didn’t want to pay for a monthly VPS but were struggling finding a <b>trustworthy safe place</b> to keep their coins.<br>One of the things we
                      realized quickly with MyStakingWallet is that not everyone has a computer that is capable of being online 24/7 to stake, and even then some people don’t have a computer at all <br><br> What was worse was that because
                      MyStakingWallet had large costs for us to operate meant that a good chunk of users in far away countries couldn’t afford the USD costs associated with a MSW account.<br><br>Because of this <b>we took it upon ourselves to create
                        a pool that all of our users could participate in regardless of their locale or computer skills.</b> One that allowed people to feel secure when leaving their coins in a pool because they knew they could trust the operators.
                      Expanding MyNodePool would become an inevitability to us in the near future, as more users began using it we began expanding and offering more coins to pool.

                      The start of MyStakingWallet is complicated, but the idea had spurted out of a constant desire and search for a competent, non custodial wallet service that offered the ability to do anything a full node could, while also
                      retaining mobile access. After much searching and being unable to find such a wallet on the market <b>We figured why not make it ourselves?</b> This is where the many months of research and development came in, <b>building the
                        first mobile staking and MN wallet that runs full nodes ALL the time while still being fully non custodial.</b> The need for a solid wallet isn’t exclusive to our team either, we believe truly and fully that a great wallet is
                      the start of adoption. If it is easy to use, people will use it

                      Once we completed most of the MyStakingWallet application and had our beta testers using the web portion, we knew it was time to get our mobile apps working. For us mobile apps were a requirement, as we knew that there would be
                      no ‘mass adoption’ on a web wallet, it needed to work on your phone and it needed to do it well. <br>Abiding by all of the rules and regulations for each app hoster was not easy, Apple in particular makes it very hard with
                      restrictions to what kinds of things can be stored on the device itself make interfacing with a wallet an outside-job. Through many reviews and a little bit of clever programming we were able to get our Apple app passed --
                      <b>the hard part was over!</b> Google has a much more lenient stance on Cryptocurrency as a whole and they had no issues with our application. <br><br>Originally we had posted our apps with a small cost, but we found that to be
                      rather counter-intuitive.. If we wanted everyone to use our wallet, we’d have to make the application as freely accessible as costs would allow, and that meant switching the app to free once released.

                      and that neither would take precedence over the other, and so we came up with the community presale. This gave everyone an opportunity (No matter what country they reside in) to take part in the ICO or presale of LindaX itself
                      by swapping Linda for LX. This was a resounding success with many many of our users taking part and grabbing their piece of LX for later use. Without this presale we wouldn’t have been able to procure the partners we have for

                  </div>
                  <div class="roadmap__task--desc">
                    <p>In 2018, Metrix made the move away from being a hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake (PoW/PoS) coin to be POS exclusively. Many reasons were had for taking such action, including a greater focus on staking and masternodes, as
                      well as a friendler environmental approach to cryptocurrency. We all have read the reports over the previous few years about the toll that mining rigs have taken on the environment via their large reliance on the use of
                      electricity to keep the miners’ equipment up and running. With PoS, Metrix has done away with bulky mining solutions and allows users to run their wallets from their laptops, desktops, or mobile phones, greatly reducing carbon
                      emissions that are so detrimental to the Earth. This focus on environmental sustainability has made Metrix a global cryptocurrency leader in this arena.
                      <br><br>
                      As mentioned, the decision to do away with PoW has led to a more concise focus on PoS technology. Seeking mass adoption involves incorporating easy-to-use solutions to what can sometimes be an overwhelming process for those not
                      attuned with how technology works. <b>By creating user friendly applications like our wallets, pool, and mobile apps, Metrix has made staking coins easier than it has ever been. </b>In most cases, the average user can start up
                      the Metrix application of their choice, hit one button, and start to see results. Over the past year, the new ownership has listened to the community who talk openly about their support for the staking process, and the
                      excitement over being a part of the Metrix network. Being rewarded for their work is only fair, and we want as many members of the Metrix community to feel the joy of being a part of a cryptocurrency network. <br> <br>

                    <p>One of the most requested moves that the Metrix team heard this year from the community was to be listed on a cryptocurrency exchange that dealt in high volume. The team delivered. <br><br>Near the end of 2018, Linda was listed
                      for trading on the Mongolian based exchange Idax, <b>a top-10 exchange by volume</b>. The new exchange opened up higher liquidity for Metrix supporters, and increased the reach Metrix is hoping to see globally by tapping into
                      the Asian marketplace. The new exchange listing came at just the right time as well. Only weeks after opening this avenue, New Zealand based crytpocurrency exchange Cryptopia had to shut down all activity due to a hack. This was
                      Metrix’s largest volume exchange, and with Idax available, those looking to buy Metrix had another higher profile option, alongside CoinExchange. This feat has really helped Metrix in 2019, as Idax is now routinely bringing in
                      volume of 5-10 btc per day during the beginning of the new bull run in cryptocurrency. <br>Creating new high profile listings on top-10 exchanges is not always as easy as simply saying that a new exchange needs to happen. It
                      takes hard work, receptive exchanges, and capital. Metrix was able to accomplish this monumental goal, and added to its list of goals achieved in the past year. The community responded with more support than ever before, and the
                      future of adding even more exchanges remains on the radar for the ownership at Metrix!

                      One of the greatest improvements that the new ownership has done at Metrix is take on talented, experienced developers to improve the Metrix blockchain. With questionable projects and teams in the cryptocurrency industry, it is
                      imperative that Metrix showcase their commitment to being the hardest workers in the business so that anyone who looks into the project will be confident in knowing that this development team is one that strives for perfection
                      and legitimacy.<br> Working tirelessly over the past year, Metrix has climbed up the ranks of active development teams. Breaking into the <b>top-100 of all the projects in cryptocurrency</b>. Currently, over 2000 teams exist, so
                      Metrix takes great pride in the work ethic put forth, and in May of 2019 were ecstatic to be ranked as the 82nd busiest team in all of crypto. This is a great achievement, but far from where Metrix is headed. We hold steadfast
                      in our desire to be a <b>top-10</b> cryptocurrency project that all the industry can look to for an example of what it takes to create and innovate at the highest level. <br>We strongly believe that development is the precursor
                      to any other gains that a project can enjoy, and will continue to devote the necessary resources to our goal of global dominance.

                      One of the more adoption centric features that our team will introduce is Metrix (MRX) Short Addresses. These Short Addresses will bridge the gap for all ages and levels of familiarity with blockchain technology. This element
                      will supply novice or experienced users the option to create a shorter address for a transaction destination. Instead of long alphabetical and numerical wallet addresses, which is standard up to date, Metrix users and
                      contributors will be capable of creating a smaller transaction address.<br><br> Once implemented, the Short Address feature will allow you to easily change a long complicated address into something as simple as your name or
                      keyword. For example: <b>"Send 10,000 MRX to Oxfish"</b>.

                      MyStakingWallet (MSW) was our first application, providing multiple communities with a simplistic user-friendly mobile wallet. We aim to make 50 additional coins available on MSW this year. Listing <b>50 more coins</b> on MSW
                      will help with the adoption of multiple different digital assets, and benefit the blockchain industry collectively, on a global scale. <br>This tactic further opens Metrix to cross promotion with exposure to other communities,
                      and potentially integration with or adoption by those communities. This milestone will be mutually beneficial to Metrix and all additional listings, while also exhibiting the advantages in the eco-friendly method of staking and
                      running masternodes right from the convenience of the users mobile device.
